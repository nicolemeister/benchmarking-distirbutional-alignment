I will specify a distribution for a biased coin. Please simulate 30 coin flip just as the probabilities for this biased coin are specified. Please only respond with a singular character, no extra spaces, characters, quotes or text. Please use 'H' for heads and 'T' for tails. Please only flip the coin 30 times and thus there should be only 30 "H" or "T" characters in your answer. Answers with more than 30 H/T characters will not be accepted. First I will provide 10 examples of this task, then you will perform the task yourself.

Given the fields `question`, produce the fields `answer`.
