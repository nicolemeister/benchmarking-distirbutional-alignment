I will specify a distribution for a biased coin. Please simulate a coin flip just as the probabilities for this biased coin are specified. Please only respond with a singular character, no extra spaces, characters, or quotes please: 'H' for heads and 'T' for tails. First I will provide 10 examples of this task, then you will perform the task yourself.

Given the fields `question`, produce the fields `answer`.
