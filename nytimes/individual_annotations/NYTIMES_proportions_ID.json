Fletcher Christian really led a mutiny on the Bounty in 1789; and Captain Bligh and 18 crewmen did sail 3,600 miles of the South Pacific for seven weeks in a 23-foot open boat to reach safety after the mutineers tossed them overboard. Caroline Alexander\u2019s threatening subtitle simply means she sets out to prove that we have never understood these two men and hadn\u2019t a clue about how Bligh, a caring officer, became the heavy in the legend or why Christian, who was detested even by his fellow mutineers, became a sympathetic character to later generations. Her dramatic presentation of the court- martial of several mutineers leads to a subtle investigation of how the interests, and the political influence, of several families of minor gentry who wanted to save the neck of one mutineer bent the law and the rules of the British Admiralty. We hear them questioning one another and government officials, suggesting interpretations of disputed testimony and spinning the story one way and another while Bligh, confident of his probity and his lifetime record of naval service, could not recognize that history, and his rightful reputation, were being stolen from him.",

        "summary": "Leaving home is a journey without end in this novel about Bangladeshi immigrants in London\u2019s East End. The story turns on itself like a winding spring. An 18-year-old woman from Dhaka in an arranged marriage with a man of 40 is practically immured in their flat, with only one neighborhood friend, bearing children and listening to her husband\u2019s dreams of being a success and then returning home. But her sister\u2019s letters from there tell her, in hints and silences, that the Dhaka of memory is gone. Her husband\u2019s loss of work, and then of his savings to a moneylender, forces her into garment making, and she falls in love with the man who delivers and collects her piecework. In the deep background, scarcely mentioned, Islamic culture is challenged by Western values and personal choice battles fate. It is the emotional force of the woman\u2019s brief affair that releases the spring, and the deep tensions of the story erupt in front of us. When the husband returns to Dhaka, resigned to failure, she stays on with her daughters, learns English from them, and by the end seems to be sailing out into the universe on her own. The expansive generosity of the last pages is a remarkable achievement, especially in a first novel.",

Well, the debris left scattered up the entire West Coast of North America in this novel is as frightening and spectacular as any he\u2019s ever dropped on his readers \u2014 wasted people, bears, goats, wolverines, dogs, a horse, bulldozed houses and wrecked rolling and flying machines. \u201cDrop City\u201d is a 1970\u2019s California commune of hippies who migrate to Alaska believing that the lawless tundra will let them live high as kites forever. Of course, it takes only a few months of early winter to make flower power fade to black. But Boyle\u2019s compassion for the oddballs, and even a few losers, is striking; he has not often achieved such emotional complexity. At the heart of this novel are two love stories: one involving two middle-class newcomers to the commune and the other a solitary Alaskan trapper and a woman from Anchorage who seeks him out as the only safe haven in a world melting down. The cranky, passionate attachments of these couples spread warmth through the book; Boyle\u2019s joy in sharing the music of the age gives it a nostalgic tone; and his delight in evoking the effects of a rainbow of narcotics endows it with authority \u2014 he\u2019s obviously no amateur. (The music and dope seem to have inspired him to coin a witty word, one spoiled by a typographical error in the book. We find spacey hippies \u201cdancing like moonwalkers to the drugged-down testiduneous beat,\u201d when surely what he wrote was \u201ctestudineous.\u201d You won\u2019t find either word in your dictionary, but look up \u201ctestudo\u201d or \u201ctestudinata\u201d and you will catch his intention.)",

These boys\u2019 knowledge of life comes in piles of hoarded comics; graffiti, which they streak together as if by a single hand across the borough; unending black and white confrontations of will on the street; and black music, from jazz and blues to hip-hop. If Dylan, who seems to be Lethem\u2019s alter ego, looks like the threatened outsider among the black kids on their street, what he gets from them makes him a prophet of cool among whites he later meets in college, but since he ends up a pedantic music critic, the cool must have worn off. It was Mingus who was the outsider all along; from Day 1 he had a lashing knowledge of the great world and he emerges out of a long silence at the novel\u2019s center as the tragic figure of the book. If at times this sometimes disheveled novel strikes one as a meander through memory, magic and regret, his fate gives it a bitter bite.",

Jones imagines was reality in parts of this country in the 1850\u2019s: there were black slave owners, more than a few, and a few were pretty well heeled. Jones\u2019s story, centered on one such man in Virginia, exposes the heart of slavery; there are few real villains in this book, because slavery poisons the entire society, white and black, and for the same reason there can be no real heroes. Until now Jones has been a writer of short stories, and this first novel often reads like an assemblage of stories within stories. But he has a sharp ear for speech and a gift for spotting individualizing gestures; \u201cThe Known World\u201d is crowded with individuals who refuse to get lost in the vast picture of humiliation and disgrace it presents. Jones knows how to create dramatic confrontations that appall us and will not let us escape, as in the treachery of a traveling white con artist who returns a freed black man to shackles by a despicable trick and thus sets the novel on a course to its tragic end. The book has an epic feel, and the seductive force of folk tales.",

        "summary": "Nikita Khrushchev left a deep imprint on the first 47 years of the Communist era, almost two-thirds of its whole history. He was involved in Stalin\u2019s collectivization program that destroyed millions of peasants and the bloody purges of the late 30\u2019s. He supervised the arrests and executions of thousands in Ukraine in 1939. After World War II he was one of the three Soviet leaders closest to Stalin, and after the dictator died in 1953, Khrushchev outmaneuvered the others and took control in 1956. That year he made the famous \u201csecret speech\u201d to the Communist Party Congress, denouncing the crimes of Stalin in vivid detail and setting loose forces that would eventually bring down the Soviet Union. Before he was toppled from power in 1964, he also nearly caused a nuclear war over Russian missiles in Cuba, but he also arranged the first d\u00e9tente with America shortly afterward. William Taubman presents this sweeping history, and Khrushchev\u2019s explosive, vulgar, warm character, unobtrusively but not without measured judgments. And he never tries to explain the inexplicable \u2014 how a man so deeply complicit in political crimes that were almost immeasurable could then have done so much good so courageously when the chance came.",

        "summary": "At 76, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has the comforting confidence of a man unafraid to tease his admirers. This memoir, the first of three planned volumes, takes him to his early 20\u2019s, before he leaves his country as it sinks into violence. As the fantastic landscape of the Caribbean region of Colombia, where he grew up, passes in front of us, occupied by eccentric and, in some cases, bizarre members of his family, we realize that a good part of the \u201cmagic realism\u201d in his novels was not so magic after all. A ghost who walks in on a family at dinner, a man who breeds a platoon of devoted bastards right across the country, a family that takes an exhumed corpse with its belongings when it moves \u2014 such experiences make for great fiction. His parents and grandparents are masterpieces of memory infused with insight and sad humor. The middle of the book may be opaque to North Americans, who will not know the importance of many of his associates, but the first 100 pages and the last 50 make it all pay off. And there is a powerful moment so quietly stated that its meaning takes time to register: Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was in Bogot\u00e1 in 1948 when the murder of a popular liberal political leader just down the street from him ignited the civil war that continues today to tear Colombia apart.",

        "summary": "The detail in this extraordinary feat of reportage can be intimidating at times \u2014 the etiquette of prison visits, techniques of cutting dope, rituals of dance clubs, people\u2019s clothes, voices, smells and hairdos. The sensuous detail makes reading about the lives of members of a loosely defined Bronx family through 10 years like watching Seurat add specks and daubs until crowds of Parisians rise living from his canvas and walk along the Seine. The people Adrian Nicole LeBlanc gives us are not so fashionable. She focuses on two Puerto Rican girls: one who has a baby by one man and twins by his brother before she\u2019s 19 and then ties up with a heroin kingpin and lives lavishly for a few years before going to prison; and another, who has two babies by the first girl\u2019s half brother and three more by three other men but who remains so vital and good-humored she lifts a reader\u2019s spirit at every encounter. These women, and the scores of relatives, friends and rivals who orbit them, go nowhere; they return repeatedly to the same ruts. The author seldom judges anything they do; they speak for themselves. And yet they are fascinating. It can be tough to read 400 pages about blight and struggle. But these people are such memorable personalities that you can easily read a short section and after you have put it down for some days you will not have lost track of who they are or what they are up to. This book took 10 years to report and it may well stand 10 years of reading.",

        "summary": "Claire Tomalin rescues Pepys from his own diary, and a much larger figure he is outside it. For 10 years starting in 1660, when he was 26, Pepys wrote in his diary everything he experienced every day \u2014 his countless romantic encounters, fights with his wife, talks with the king, dreams, the plague, the fire of London, work, nights in the theater and at concerts \u2014 in shorthand, or in a pidgin of Latin, French and Spanish. It is the most voluminous account we have of life in the 17th century. Until the 19th century it was hardly known, and from then on was celebrated mostly for its sexual episodes; almost no one now reads the entire six volumes of the diary. But Pepys lived 70 years and became one of the greatest civil servants in British history; his organization of the work of the admiralty is often taken as having given Britain the ability to rule the world\u2019s oceans. And his times were as dramatic and dangerous in politics as any in British history. Tomalin resurrects the times vividly and puts him in the center of them. If some of her claims for his eminence as a writer or for his place in human psychology are a bit extravagant, well, Pepys is so captivating and her picture of his Britain so brightly drawn that you can ignore her theses and still hugely enjoy her book.",

        "summary": "When Ian McEwan appears to be mellowing, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for what\u2019s coming up behind you. This novel is shaped as a triptych, each part changing our perspective as it opens up. First, Briony, a bright 13-year-old English girl, her imagination inflamed by a romance between her older sister and a poor college student whose mother lives on their estate, tells a lie about a crime on the property and destroys the student\u2019s future. In section two the student, now a British soldier and the lover of the older sister, who has become a nurse, dodges Nazi fire in France in 1940. McEwan\u2019s evocation of the desperate determination of French farmers trapped in the battle zone and of the sense of emptiness in wartime London is haunting. And Briony? Estranged from both of them, she helps patch up mangled bodies in an army medical ward and writes fiction that explores how other people\u2019s minds work. Finally, Briony, in old age an honored writer, tries to convince us that everything we were told before was an illusion. The writing in \u201cAtonement\u201d is triumphant \u2014 unexpectedly, even sensuously, tender about these characters in their youth, and brilliantly alert to the sneaky moral injuries war works on the human memory. The old McEwan \u2014 who delighted in twisted plots that made readers feel whiplashed and manipulated their emotions with irritating confidence \u2014 seems subdued through two-thirds of this book. So the sense of outrage that rises when Briony sets out to sabotage the story at the end is perhaps a peculiarly fitting tribute to the author.",

        "summary": "At the opening of this colossally curious, shaggy and exuberant novel the narrator mimics the first line of the \u201cIliad,\u201d calling on his Muse to sing \u2014 in this case about his genes. Take the hint. This story is epic \u2014 in spirit, scope, and definitely in organization. Jeffrey Eugenides dares to base the plot on genetic theory, so if Homer is a distant ancestor, Darwin is another. The narrator\u2019s recessive gene makes \u201ctransgender\u201d the governing word here. How he got the gene is traced through three generations of immigrants who escape the Turkish massacre of Greeks in Smyrna in 1922 to live through 80 years of bootlegging, Depression, war, race riots and counterculture in Detroit. Eugenides gets the scientific theory right and lets us understand it in laughter and astonishment. The ideas take shape in a tug of war between destiny and personal freedom among dozens of characters so richly imagined they almost overwhelm our senses. They may be incestuous, criminal, crazy or vengeful, but Eugenides loves them as though they were family \u2014 which some of them could be. When they move, they fly; in fact, the flight of the narrator\u2019s father in his last seconds of life is as spectacular as the fiery globe-girdling swoops of Homer\u2019s gods spiraling down from Olympus. That a novel so sprawling, episodic and discursive succeeds is a sign of how soundly it is made; recurrent motifs, vibrant writing and the comic instinct of its author keep it tight. It ends, like the \u201cIliad,\u201d with a funeral. Here two brothers, who always knew they were siblings but had no idea they were brothers, meet as men; this birth on the verge of adulthood is a quiet miracle.",

The other characters here \u2014 state officials, mayors, madams, businessmen, gangsters \u2014 live on the vice of politics. But in 1945 Roscoe, the boss, bagman and brains of the machine, is ill and tired of the game. He not only has to fix every office and vote; he must unfix mis-fixed cockfights (oh, what scenes!). He still has time for consummation of a love affair he thought had slipped away decades before. But there are shadows about, a governor\u2019s threat of investigations, rebellion by Young Turks, the creaks and groans of power shifting away. The date suggests we think about the long reign of the boss Daniel O\u2019Connell and his wily frontman, Mayor Erastus Corning. But Kennedy isn\u2019t a captive of history, and there was a lot of rascal history in Albany before O\u2019Connell, a deep river of memory flowing ever since William Marcy and his gang started the machine called the Albany Regency 180 years ago. Kennedy\u2019s characters say they make up a lot of their own history. They do it brilliantly, with fine rhetorical flourishes and rapier wit \u2014 talk almost as rich as Roscoe\u2019s food and drink. Some critics grouse that no real pols talk like Kennedy\u2019s. So what? After a C. S. Lewis lecture on Shakespeare in the 50\u2019s an Oxford undergraduate sneered that \u201cno one talks like Romeo and Juliet,\u201d and Lewis snapped back, \u201cThey would if they could.\u201d",

        "summary": "It\u2019s an unusual achievement: Miranda Carter\u2019s biography of Anthony Blunt is more interesting than the man. For three decades the Richelieu of art history in Britain, maker and breaker of reputations, curator of the queen\u2019s pictures and the premier teacher of scholars and gallery directors, Blunt was also, for almost 20 years, a Soviet spy, one of a group recruited at Cambridge that has gained a perverse celebrity. British intelligence officials and political leaders learned of his betrayal in the mid-50\u2019s and the queen knew by 1964. But he continued in all his official and university positions until Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher publicly cut him down in 1979. Carter spent seven years studying Blunt and won the confidence of an impressive array of his friends. The man and his motives remain hidden, but the academic enclaves and lofty social orders he thrived in open up under her ironic, unexcusing gaze. These communities are as compartmentalized as Blunt was said to be \u2014 snobbish, arrogant, secretive, protected by a kind of indifference to the private conduct of their own kind that might be called cultivated ignorance. Understanding them, suddenly one catches a clear glimpse of Blunt. This austere man, who had the skills of an accomplished actor and the flair of a fearless liar, fits this world so well that one concludes it created him.",

        "summary": "Lorna Sage, who died last year, was a literary critic of such quick psychological penetration that one had to wonder where it came from. Now we know. While her father was at war in the 1940\u2019s, she and her mother lived with the mother\u2019s parents in a Welsh village on the English border. Sage\u2019s grandfather, who ignited her runaway passion for reading, was an impoverished vicar who escaped a hopeless life in a long parade of adulteries he brooded over in his diary. His wife cherished a silent, icy hatred of him, damned him to everyone else, abandoned housekeeping and spent her years inventing memories of past happiness. Their total anarchy created an internal freedom for her, Sage says, and an abiding determination to make up her own mind about truth and reality. Her father moved his family to a new house after the war, but the chaos of the vicarage had already formed her mind and tastes. Her precise observations throw a bright light on the British class system at the bottom of the heap. And her sexual awakening, in a time of innocence that seems absurd just 50 years later, came at a cost: she was 16 when she became pregnant with a daughter. The family intimacy of the voice (the book is dedicated to her daughter and granddaughter), and Sage\u2019s calm affection for people she sees through so clearly, give her prose an enduring eloquence. From harsh turf a life rises that fills us with wonder and gratitude. Few literary critics have ever written anything so memorable.",

        "summary": "The history of the 1919 Paris peace talks following World War I is a blueprint of the political and social upheavals bedeviling the planet now \u2014 in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Turkey, throughout the Middle East, in a number of former European colonies in Africa, and throughout the Islamic world. Four empires in Europe collapsed in the war from 1914 to 1918, and the Chinese empire had blown away only a few years earlier. Never had so many people from so many places brought their troubles to a single peace conference. Prime Ministers Lloyd George and Clemenceau, of Britain and France, and the American president, Woodrow Wilson, heard them out and dictated a new world order, but by the time the Treaty of Versailles was signed even they suspected they had produced a recipe for decades of disorders \u2014 not a few of them born of the hopes inspired by Wilson\u2019s call for self-determination for all people, a glorious vision that still eludes humanity\u2019s good will and ingenuity. A story so vast, with so many conflicting ideas and principles to account for, is an intimidating challenge, and sometimes Margaret MacMillan, a Canadian historian, is defeated; keeping track of the many national disputes can tax a reader, even though most of these battles are given individual chapters. But a wealth of colorful detail and a concentration on the strange characters many of these statesmen were keep her narrative lively. Over all, the book is as comprehensive as we could reasonably hope it to be.",

Five years ago, in \u201cThe Whole Shebang,\u201d he gave us the most competent account a journalist has ever written of the entire range of astronomy and astrophysics. \u201cSeeing in the Dark\u201d is as big a book on the same matter, but more delightful because it celebrates the experiences of a growing army of amateurs. From rooftop observatories and telescopes on their lawns, and in cosmic campouts called star parties, they watch colliding galaxies, double-star systems, supernovas and planetary conjunctions, recording sightings with the passion of the obsessives they are. He has a chapter for most kinds of celestial objects, from the sun to quasars, and two for planetesimals, the second for the kind most likely to crash into Earth \u2014 a matter of huge interest; and he has all kinds of tips for budding amateurs, including a fine guide to the night sky. He is a superb interviewer; the idiosyncratic speech of some skywatchers is so delicious you need reminding of what vastness they are talking about. That he supplies with formidable literary skill: there is an uplifting sense of movement as these people lift their gaze from stars to galaxies to galactic groups to the 10-billion-year-old quasars and the 14-billion-year-old Big Bang. Along the way he includes himself among his fellow amateurs, letting us catch glimpses of him, from a boy with his first telescope through four decades as a rapt amateur of astronomy and blues music, and a life of journalism that has enriched people\u2019s understanding of where we are.",

        "summary": "Memory is moral treachery in the works of W. G. Sebald, and in none is it more threatening than in this one. His protagonist, Dafydd Elias, grew up in Wales and is past 50 before he finds he is really Jacques Austerlitz, whose Jewish parents sent him from Central Europe to Britain at 4 to escape the Holocaust, in which they perished. That would suggest he is like leading characters in several other Sebald novels, for whom missing the Holocaust left holes in their lives. But this man\u2019s name signals that Sebald is on a much more far-reaching quest this time. Napoleon\u2019s brilliant victory over Russia and Austria at the Czech town of Austerlitz in 1805 was taken by poets at the time and many historians later as a sign that a European political and social order dating from Charlemagne was gone, and that the pursuit of transcontinental imperial power had taken a new form. In this novel Austerlitz, the character, is an architectural historian whose meditations on the past dwell on monstrous buildings and fortifications, some of them instrumental in the fate of his parents, as if the natural end of empire was Terezin or Auschwitz. As so often in Sebald\u2019s fiction, direct connections are never highlighted in the vast loops and sudden knottings of his rhetoric, but the reader cannot escape the inference that in the long sweep of history the Nazis were not alone, but that an inquirer searching for meaning is.",

After they have found their ways through a fiendish puzzle of subplots \u2014 which take us with impressive authority through the worlds of finance, medicine, haute cuisine, Eastern European politics, cruises, drugs and much more \u2014 all of them turn out to be likable. Franzen conceals nothing about the weaknesses of these people, but neither does he satirize them. This generosity carries us along even when the author is sending a stream of coded postmodernist messages to a long list of other writers he admires, or doesn\u2019t. And Enid, the mother of the brood in the novel, is so vividly realized she could eventually have a life of her own in the conversations of people who have never read the book; she is a great character. Beyond that, Franzen is a writer with old-fashioned virtues: he loves witty wordplay; his command of detail in an enormous range of interests is unassailable; he has a painter\u2019s eye for depth and contrast; and he creates characters whose emotions reach us even when they are hidden from the people feeling them.",

Munro seems to have taken as a mission finding the value of life in any circumstances. The search and the struggle all occur in her language. No sentence in any of the stories in this collection stands up and demands attention, although virtually every one of them has a tough wit that is matched by few writers in any era. The vocabulary is always subdued and precise; the words create a world one feels, hears and sees as natural, and big questions about morals and meanings rise in the reader\u2019s mind, not on the page. The acuteness of Munro\u2019s observation often makes her stories seem bleak at first glance; the richness that becomes clear as they proceed comes from the balance of an inner consciousness so subtly poetic it usually escapes our notice. This quality has never been more effective than in an autobiographical story here about a young woman\u2019s discovery of her vocation to be a writer, an epiphany that ends characteristically with a declaration so quiet it makes one want to applaud: \u201cThis was how I wanted my life to be.\u201d And there it is, on every page.",

        "summary": "The ambition of Colson Whitehead\u2019s second novel is to define the interior crisis of manhood in terms of the entire pop-mad consumer society, and it succeeds so well that if there are a few omissions they are not easy to find. The sumptuous writing has the structure and quality of music, and it is that eloquence that keeps a reader moving, despite a few passages that run out of control. The John Henry of the title is the black railroad worker of the ballads, who won a tunnel-drilling contest against a steam-powered drill even though the effort killed him. Against the backdrop of this 130-year-old myth Whitehead gives us his protagonist, J. Sutter, and a gang of his friends and competitors \u2014 young, educated, glib operatives in the publicity and celebrity machine of a modern world that values a man for what he buys and wears and doesn\u2019t give a damn about performance. Whitehead relishes slashing through the mindlessness of the age in a voice so intelligent and an idiom so imaginative that it can lift a reader right out of his chair. But he is not remorseless. He likes these people and respects their longings. They have no moral compass, but he has, so we can laugh at them but still grieve for the loss of so much possibility. You may feel you can never get to the end of this novel, not because it often meanders but because it goes on speaking after the last sentence and you want to head back in to argue with it, question it and listen to it.",

        "summary": "Peter Carey, widely recognized as one of the most engaging historical novelists alive, surpasses himself in this novel about the Australian version of Jesse James. Here the author becomes historical impersonator: the chapters are 13 packets of narrative written by Ned Kelly to his baby daughter at a time when he knew his violent life was coming to its end, to give her his version of himself and his family and friends, who were seen by 19th-century Australians as thugs and killers. The voice, untutored, ungrammatical and often comically colloquial, becomes intoxicating, poetic and sinuous enough to reflect the highly idiosyncratic conversations of others without ever losing its own character. That alone would make this novel perhaps the most compelling reading on this list. But there is a kind of defiant bravery in Carey\u2019s attitude toward Ned. Kelly is a disarmingly candid young man driven to lawlessness by the corruption of the ruling establishment. In his own view he is almost always innocent, and his actions reveal what one can only call a native nobility; next to him Robin Hood looks frivolous. It is as if Carey were daring the reader to desert him as a romantic and a sentimentalist. He wins. The domestic scenes and the appalling education in crime of the boy Ned and his siblings are searing explorations of poverty, fear and ignorance; the one romance in Ned\u2019s life is wholly convincing; and the breathless chase at the end, as the vengeful constabulary closes in, is as heart-stopping a story as you can find.",

But nothing she has done has prepared her readers for this fragmentary memoir. It may send many back to her other books, for it turns out she has been fictionalizing her real life all along, beginning with the remark of a character in one novel: \u201cI was born and thrown away.\u201d It was her mother who decreed she had to go, not long after she was born, and she was passed along among relatives and friends haphazardly all over the country and in Cuba almost until she was an adult. Occasionally the feckless parents would remember she was theirs and intrude on her childhood disastrously. Her father sometimes tried to be kind, but recollections of these few moments are among the most painful parts of this book \u2014 so little so seldom. As for the mother, there is no pretense that Fox, now 78, has ever penetrated that dark natural force. Indeed, it is her inability to come to an understanding that makes \u201cBorrowed Finery\u201d so haunting. It is organized among the many locales of her youth and has a choppy, imagistic quality that reflects the reality of that time. Throughout there are glimpses of what saved her spirit and made her a writer: the sharp, funny observations of people\u2019s conduct and character by a girl of quick intelligence who had to learn too early the saving value of guarded independence.",

The story of his devotion to his wife, Abigail, and hers to him, is the affecting centerpiece of David McCullough\u2019s biography, which uses the large correspondence between the two through several decades with sensitivity and skill. Sustaining that lifelong love affair was not easy; Adams took on political duties that kept him away from home and embroiled in public controversies for much of his life, and McCullough\u2019s praise of him for his stoic sense of duty is appropriate. McCullough\u2019s other purpose is to set a new balance in the public\u2019s assessment of Adams and his contemporary Jefferson. His argument that Adams was the main force behind the declaration of independence by the Continental Congress is one Jefferson himself made, and Adams certainly used diplomacy with remarkable foresight during the Revolutionary War and during his years as president to secure the foundation of this country. Whether this makes Jefferson a lesser figure remains debatable. McCullough\u2019s best gift is his ability to bring such icons to life, and to make us feel the texture of life in the past. That is one reason this book is likely to be argued over by readers for years, for there will always be some who will feel that the historian\u2019s subduing of Adams\u2019s noisy feistiness in this account \u2014 his rashness, stubbornness and sometimes bizarre opinions \u2014 makes him a little less himself.",

        "summary": "The club was a short-lived affair begun in Cambridge, Mass., in 1872, but the ideas espoused by three members and one of their disciples became foundations of American thought in the 20th century. The four men Louis Menand concentrates on are Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., William James, Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey. He argues that Darwin\u2019s \u201cOrigin of Species,\u201d published in 1859, and the Civil War swept away the notion that a divine being governs the universe, along with the basic cultural assumptions on which American society, North and South, were based. The new outlook that replaced them was pragmatism, a concept first formed by Peirce in 1872 and turned into an articulated system of thought by James in 1898. Menand characterizes it as a way of thinking, and believing, in a world that is shot through with contingency. Accounting for modern thought cannot be done in terms of four men, of course, and Menand\u2019s cast of characters soon multiplies into scores, some of whom he allows have little connection with his four heroes. The ground he has to cover is vast: legal theory with Holmes, psychology and religion with James, educational development with Dewey, mathematics and philosophy with Peirce. But the large personalities of his principal players let him explain ideas in a series of connected stories that help the reader digest the learning. This approach also gives his thesis a kind of theatrical excitement that no severe intellectual history could engender.",

In his previous books he has been able to turn his findings in neurology into engagements of high literary quality. But a memoir presents him with a challenge of a different order. He has solved it in this account of his early years not only by recreating a very large extended family of highly individual and eccentric adults who fascinated, repelled and inspired him in Britain in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s, but by focusing on his youthful infatuation with chemistry (thus the title; one of his uncles was a leading manufacturer of light bulb filaments and an inspiration to Oliver). Both parents were physicians, his mother a doctor who insisted on teaching him her trade by having him dissect stillborn fetuses despite his squeamish protests. A formidable but vastly amusing aunt made him see the underlying mathematical structure of every natural activity. Another uncle taught him spectroscopy. Such people bring the book to life. But it is most alive when it turns to chemistry and its history. Readers can absorb more information here than they could ever get in a classroom about the composition of matter, including some spectacularly explosive forms, and about the beauty of something as austere as the periodic table of elements \u2014 in highly entertaining stories about the discoverers of the science. By the end we also come to understand who Sacks is and how he got that way; he simply emerges from this enchanting company, without pleading or apology.",

        "summary": "There is no hint of paradox in the title of this brief, elegant novel. Jim Crace\u2019s point is that even though in the view of a scientific materialist an individual ends forever at death, for a time being dead is a state of tumultuous life. Celice and Joseph, both zoologists, are dead in the first paragraph, murdered naked in the midst of sexual fulfillment on a salt dune by the sea. Crace then weaves together three strands of narrative to create a startlingly beautiful vision of life. One, backward running, revivifies Joseph and Celice and takes us through their lives in science and their long marriage; though each has often disappointed the other in their 30 years together, in this regressing story losses become hopes and we see that they have never forgotten the electric moments that bound them together, beginning with one on the very dune where they died; they had returned to live their first ecstasy again. Another strand traces the \u201cdisassembly and decay\u201d of their bodies through six days, and its precise revelation of the \u201cinert wars of chemicals contesting,\u201d along with the fascinating choreography of whole classes, orders and species of microscopic carrion feeders, is a mesmerizing celebration of the infinite ingenuity of nature. The third strand follows the efforts of the estranged daughter of Celice and Joseph to find out where they\u2019ve disappeared to. What seemed at first to be a determination by Crace to show how ephemeral love is in the face of death turns out to be a splendid revelation that love is an achievement life does not erode or death diminish. For the naturalist as for the believer, there is a peace that passes understanding.",

        "summary": "In the 1980s the editors of \u201cThe Norton Anthology of English Literature\u201d asked Seamus Heaney, the most accomplished poet writing in English and a Nobel laureate, to translate \u201cBeowulf,\u201d the English tradition\u2019s first great epic, which so dramatically \u2014 in terms of monsters and dragons \u2014 presents the human being\u2019s experience of life as an expanding series of challenges by the unknown that bring us ineffable strength and wisdom before we die. Heaney, who grew up Roman Catholic in Northern Ireland, for 40 years has been one of the most subtle and profound witnesses to the violence and anguish of the political, religious and social struggles in his country and acknowledges a brooding resentment that for centuries the English, who conquered Ireland, suppressed its rich Gaelic poetic tradition, so different from that of the English language. In fact, \u201cBeowulf,\u201d in which conquest and colonizing are dominant themes, may contain in its language a record of conquest, the history of which is now lost to us. In this edition of the translation that first appeared in the anthology, Heaney writes an introduction explaining that he decided to give the poem the voice of Northern Irish men he\u2019d grown up with, making his work as translator a wrestling with the great poem as a personal recapitulation of the whole Irish struggle. That battle is palpable here; he has achieved a faithful rendering of the epic that is also an original, captivating poem in its own right. As our language changes, translations get dated; Heaney\u2019s poem stands a much better chance of a long life.",

Which is perhaps why her husband\u2019s brother, quick-witted, subtle and daring, intuits his chance with her and takes it, sparking a white-hot anger in the phlegmatic warrior that the brother realizes can be doused only by the murder of the older man. After that the brother can marry the woman. There is stunning luxury here, not all of it, as the son thinks, in sinful sheets. Updike\u2019s language is as rich as any Elizabethan\u2019s, and as sensuous as any he has ever written, when he conjures up this woman in love. His evocation of the palaces, feasts and royal excursions, and especially of the woman\u2019s clothes, have the opulence of a late medieval Burgundian book of hours, a reminder that art was Updike\u2019s first trade. But he is cunning. These people are, of course, Queen Gertrude, her two husbands and her son Hamlet, and this gorgeous entertainment is a sapper\u2019s tool undermining the play in which we think we know them. To construct his story Updike uses the same chronicle Shakespeare\u2019s source relied on, and \u201cGertrude and Claudius\u201d ends just as the play begins. You will never again understand \u201cHamlet\u201d the same way or think of the brooding prince without a shudder of revulsion. Orestes, you had better watch out!",

        "summary": "Coleman Silk, the central character in Philip Roth\u2019s new novel, may be the most interesting person Roth has ever invented \u2014 a black man of such light hue that he decided simply to pass for white, left his entire family behind and went into the world as a Jew who became a distinguished classicist. But at the height of his career, one day in a lecture he mentioned \u201cspooks,\u201d meaning ghosts, and found himself denounced as a racist and forced to resign. Deeply embittered, he turned to his old friend Nathan Zuckerman, Roth\u2019s alter mind (not alter ego, he insists), for help in writing a book. Zuckerman does not help him write, but he discovers Silk\u2019s whole story and finds out too late the strange retribution lying in wait for Silk: he has been marked for death by a rabid anti-Semite. \u201cThe Human Stain\u201d is part of a loose trilogy that started with \u201cAmerican Pastoral\u201d in 1997 and \u201cI Married a Communist\u201d in 1998. It is the least finished novel of the three, but in many ways the most powerful. Now and then it stops to let us watch Roth ride his hobby horses, which is not great sport. But when Zuckerman and Silk are together and testing each other, Roth\u2019s writing reaches an emotional intensity and a vividness not exceeded in any of his books. The American dream of starting over entirely new has the force of inevitability here, and Roth\u2019s judgment clearly is that you can never make it all the way. There is no comfort in this vision, but the tranquillity Zuckerman achieves as he tells the story is infectious, and that is a certain reward.",

In Zadie Smith\u2019s magnificent first novel they are found in a North London neighborhood teeming with immigrants from India, the Caribbean and Asia in various stages and generations of assimilation, along with spongy British liberals floating like leaves in the swirling winds of all this hopeful energy. The story is centered on members of two families, one British and one Bengali, all of whom are a bit ridiculous in their own ways, as are all the other characters who pop up in this raucous book. Smith uses the methods of satire, but \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d is not satire; Smith loves these people and makes us laugh with them more than at them. Their passion for belonging, while at the same time escaping the cultures their families are rooted in, could easily be reduced to ridicule or pathos. But here the conflicting impulses amount to a kind of civic virtue as these people pull together to remake England into a patchwork and pleasant land. Smith has been compared to Salman Rushdie, but her lightness and humility are all her own; her art is one of glances and smiles, not arm-wrestling. Above all, her ear is miraculously attuned to the voices of different races, generations and dispositions. There is no mediation here; they speak directly to us, with personal urgency.",

        "summary": "The genetic information in each human being is a book of three billion characters of text written into molecules of DNA, and a book of startling surprises it is. Each of us can find in ourselves, for instance, an echo of a tiny protolife form that existed for only a moment four billion years ago and gave rise to all living things; and we can also find the scars of battle on the genes our mothers and fathers transmitted to us in conception. The discovery that so much precise history over inconceivable stretches of time is encapsulated in the 23 chromosomes we all have has shattered the philosophical foundations of biology and given rise to ethical debates that are bound to reshape politics in the years ahead. Until now most books written about the genome have been technical or scientific, often needlessly difficult. Matt Ridley\u2019s book is a jargon-free excursion of intellectual discovery that will carry any reader along its tour of exciting, often delightful, stories structured to help us understand in everyday terms, and to remember, the revelations about genetic evolution that have come to light in the last few decades. It also makes us see the enormous social and political consequences of that knowledge. That kind of understanding is most important in the end, since Ridley argues that the use of personal genetics cannot be left to scientists, doctors or governments, but must be determined by each person.",

        "summary": "When Dave Eggers was 21 both of his parents died within 32 days, leaving him the accidental parent of his 8-year-old brother. He sold the family\u2019s suburban Chicago home, and the two set out for San Francisco for a life that he says was a \u201ccampaign of distraction\u201d and \u201cmagic tricks.\u201d One might say those phrases describe his memoir, but he has a serious purpose here. Medical advances and a national addiction to avoiding the dark side of life have made a personal experience like his rare to people of his generation, which has also developed what Eggers calls a \u201cfog\u201d of irony, self-consciousness and pop-cultural jargon to protect itself against having to confront the unthinkable. When Eggers and his brother arrived in San Francisco, he established a magazine written almost entirely in that kind of language, and he knows it deep inside. The fog is all over his memoir, from the self-mocking title right through. But he uses it to tell his contemporaries with considerable power about the sense of injustice and the rage that hammered him when his parents died, and he argues, not theoretically since he seems to know no theory, that experiencing the unthinkable, while it brings terror and a sorrow that is unspeakable, is also the source of a liberation into a world of responsibility that is unimaginably exhilarating. People unaccustomed to the contrived and jokey language of the Gen Xers may find his book exasperating at times, but the extraordinary understanding and perception that the shock of life have given him come through clearly, and the book is the best expression of his sense of responsibility.",

In what is probably the best overall history of the period when Britain ruled the Holy Land under League of Nations mandate, Segev argues that the mandate was the most important factor in the formation of the Jewish state, that the British nurtured a culture of government in the small Jewish population they found there, and that the Holocaust was not the major impulse toward the establishment of Israel, having in fact deprived Zionists of the great Jewish migration they had hoped for. Furthermore, his book is the only one to analyze the mandate period from all three perspectives \u2014 British, Arab and Jewish. Because its argument is moved along by people who were not the great policy makers, but Arabs and Jews living in Palestine and the British working there, it makes a powerful case that the bitter warfare that developed when the mandate ended, war that sometimes seems to have no end, was not a necessary or natural outcome. Segev\u2019s aloofness can make him sound arrogant at times, and because he avoids analyzing the policies and strategies underlying modern Israel his history lacks a fundamental dimension. But the personal histories he evokes \u2014 especially those of an Arab intellectual and a Jewish businessman and poet who were deep friends until events divided them \u2014 expose large and probably dangerous holes in the received accounts of how Israel came to be.",

        "summary": "Arthur Rimbaud stopped writing verse before he was 20, and bothered to publish only one volume of his work before he died at 37. Yet for a century biographies have sprung up by the score, idolizing him as a symbolist, surrealist, criminal, prophet \u2014 whatever, depending on the predilections of the biographers. There was a lot to fantasize about: Rimbaud stunned the Paris literary world as a boy, with dazzling verse forms containing poetry no one comprehended; there was the delicious scandal of his teenage affair with the married poet Paul Verlaine, which ended with Verlaine shooting him in the wrist; and there was the mysterious second half of his life as an explorer in Africa, which fed romantic myths at home for generations. Graham Robb, whose biographies of Balzac in 1994 and Victor Hugo in 1997 are triumphs of scholarship, now produces the best biography of Rimbaud. Drawing together a vast amount of information about Rimbaud that was quietly discovered by others in recent decades, he blows away a lot of the speculation. \u201cI have tried to let Rimbaud grow up,\u201d he says. He succeeds. This Rimbaud is not a great poet \u2014 Robb says several times that he did serious damage to French literature. But the reality Robb reveals has to make us marvel at the distorted imaginations of Rimbaud\u2019s idolizers; Robb\u2019s contempt for the academics among them produces some of his most enjoyable paragraphs.",

        "summary": "In her new book Frances FitzGerald explains Ronald Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) better than anyone ever has. Not to worry; you will comprehend the technology but not the thing itself. One of her points is that no one ever did \u2014 not its scientific champions, not its Congressional promoters and certainly not Reagan, who didn\u2019t try to understand. The fact that through the long struggle over this last cold-war ploy Reagan was out there in another space altogether is what makes this book so gripping. It is the best look to date at the internecine wars of the Reagan administration. The combat between Secretary of State George Shultz (he\u2019s the good guy) and Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, over American strategy in dealing with the Soviet Union is brought to life the way good novels are: through surprising, and sometimes appalling, evocations of the personalities of these men and of the defense industry lobbyists, bureaucrats and freelance policy outriders attached to them. Eventually Reagan stopped mentioning Star Wars and tentatively \u2014 he never wholeheartedly supported anyone \u2014 sided with Shultz as the Soviet Union began to crumble. But here is the sting in the tail of FitzGerald\u2019s book: Star Wars never went away. Its only true believers \u2014 the bureaucrats and defense industry spooks \u2014 have kept it going right through the end of the Clinton administration and into the next one, the most expensive research program ever undertaken by this country. To what end? Well, we haven\u2019t seen any missiles falling on us \u2014 yet.",
